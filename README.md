# BOTSv3 Incident Analysis 

## Introduction

In everyday cybersecurity, a Security Operations Center (SOC) is essential for 24/7 threat detection and incident response. Because modern networks generate massive amounts of data, SOC teams rely on SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems like Splunk. These tools allow analysts to collect and analyse logs to spot suspicious activity that humans might otherwise miss.

The BOTSv3 (Boss of the SOC version 3) exercise simulates this realistic environment, allowing users to gain hands-on experience through "Capture the Flag" tasks. The investigation targets the digital infrastructure of a fictional brewery called "Frothly." This complex dataset gathers data from various services, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and internal endpoint logs.

The objective of this SOC simulation is to complete the assigned set of BOTSv3’s “200-level” questions using Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL). The specific focus of this investigation is on AWS cloud infrastructure events (specifically IAM access and S3 bucket misconfigurations) and endpoint hardware analysis. The goal is to use the Cyber Kill Chain methodology to reconstruct the incident.The scope of this report is strictly limited to these assigned questions. It is assumed that the provided log data is accurate and serves as the single source of truth for this timeline.
