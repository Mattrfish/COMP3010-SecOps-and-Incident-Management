## Coursework 1 – PCAP Intrusion Analysis
In this assignment, I analysed a provided `.pcap` (packet capture) file to investigate a suspected intrusion.  
The analysis involved identifying:
- The **infected system** and its network identifiers (IP, MAC, hostname, user)
- The **method of compromise** (how the infection occurred)
- The **malware or attack type** involved
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** such as domains, IPs, etc.

These details, along with the report and supporting screenshots, can be found in the `Coursework1` folder.
